        Hello, I'm Umayr Shahid. I live and work in Toronto. I'm a software developer.
        I have worked for more than 8 years. I usually work with Javascript and Golang.
        In my free time, I like to take pictures of inanimate objects, read fantasy &amp;
        sci-fi books, and play games.

        You can find me on:
